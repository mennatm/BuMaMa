Building Maintenance Manager

This is sample project exploring hibernate and wicket.  The application uses maven and postgresSql database.
The final application will be a ToDo List for buildings maintenance project.
Depending on user role, tasks, buildings and people will be created in the system. Tasks will belong to a building 
and will be assigned to an individual.
A task has a "New" "In Progress" "Completed" "Canceled" status
Users will be able to filter list of tasks by building name, person assigned to, date created and status


This is the first wicket attempt and feedback is highly appreciated.
